# Nessie
Inside this directory we can find how I configured Nessie to be able store data and metadata information for Iceberg tables inside an S3 bucket in Minio called "test". 
The values.yaml contains the configuration to deploy the pod using Helm Chart and the notes give some additional context on how to use spark with afterwards.
