THE LAST GRAFANA OPERATOR VERSION CANNOT BE DEPLOYED THROUGH OLM BECAUSE IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE LAST VERSION OF STRIMZI OPERATOR 0.47.0 SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND INSTALL IT THROUGH A HELM CHART.
USE:  helm upgrade -i grafana-operator oci://ghcr.io/grafana/helm-charts/grafana-operator --version v5.18.0
