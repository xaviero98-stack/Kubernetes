# Kubernetes
That repository contains the necessary instructions to set up kubernetes cluster inside an on-premise cluster of nodes connected through a router with static IPs 192.168.1.150, 192.168.1.151, and 192.168.1.152.  
So far, I've been able to successfully deploy Spark on Kubernetes. Now I'll start experimenting with Kafka, ElasticSearch, AirFlow, MinIO, Neo4j, MongoDB, and other Big Data software to replicate production-like environments and conditions, including things like high availability, fault tolerance, etc...
